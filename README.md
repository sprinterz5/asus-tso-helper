> [!NOTE]

> **Early release.** Built and tested every day on an ASUS TUF Gaming A15 (FA507NV), Fedora 44,
> KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland. Other ASUS laptops supported by asusctl should work, but nobody has
> confirmed them yet. If you try one, a [report](#reporting-a-problem) helps a lot.

## Why

- **On the official stack.** asusd (asusctl) and Cardwire do all the hardware work; the app is a
  window for them. It writes no hardware files itself, and its settings stay in asusd, so they
  keep working with the app closed and never fight other asusd tools.
- **Nothing hidden, everything undoable.** Before any password prompt the app lists what it will
  change and why. Extra → System changes shows every change it made with an Undo button
  ([details](#what-it-changes-on-your-system)).
- **G-Helper's design.** Small windows that open at the tray icon, the same layout and defaults.
  The interface is [seerge's](https://github.com/seerge) work.
- **Lightweight.** A single 29 MB AppImage, or a 250 KB package on the system's Python and Qt. In
  the tray it starts no background processes, only reads a few system files every 2 seconds.
- **Notices things and says so.** When the battery drained in sleep, when an app keeps the NVIDIA
  GPU awake on battery, when a game runs in Eco or Silent, a notification says it once, with a
  button to fix it. Nothing changes unless you press it.
- **Eco without a logout.** GPU modes go through [Cardwire](https://opengamingcollective.github.io/cardwire/):
  Eco and Standard switch in a moment, and HDMI keeps working.
- **One password, once.** On first start a Setup window installs what the laptop still needs
  (asusd, Cardwire, the key rule) behind a single prompt. No terminal steps.
- **Updates in one click.** A red version label means a new release: one click downloads it,
  checks GitHub's SHA-256 and restarts into it.

## Features

<img src="docs/fans.png" width="470" align="right" alt="Fans and Power window">

**Performance**
- Silent, Balanced, Turbo and your own custom modes; each power source remembers its mode
- Fan curves for CPU and GPU, calibrated to real RPM, with factory defaults
- CPU power limits (SPL, sPPT, fPPT), NVIDIA Dynamic Boost and temperature target
- CPU Boost and the CPU's power mode (EPP) per mode
- Situations (experimental, [below](#situations)): On the go, Desk, Gaming, Quiet, each setting the
  mode, GPU, screen and keyboard light with one click

**GPU**
- Eco, Standard, Ultimate (MUX) and Optimized (Eco on battery)
- The tray tooltip names the apps keeping the dGPU awake; on battery a notification names them too
- A game started in Eco or Silent gets a hint to switch

**Screen, keyboard, battery**
- 60 Hz, max Hz or automatic by power source, panel overdrive
- Aura effects, colour, speed, brightness, backlight timeout, lighting on boot and sleep
- Charge limit (only the values the firmware keeps, on models that take just 60 / 80 / 100),
  one-time charge to 100%, battery health, time left or time to the limit
- Battery history, what each mode drew, how much a night's sleep cost

**Keys and system**
- Actions for Fn+F4, the Armoury key and other laptop keys, plus any keyboard shortcut
- MangoHud toggle, clamshell mode, run on startup
- BIOS for your model (the ASUS source G-Helper uses), kernel, NVIDIA driver, asusctl,
  Cardwire and firmware updates in one window
- Light and dark theme following the desktop, optionally in the desktop's accent colour
- English and Russian; a translation is one JSON file

## Situations

<img src="docs/situations.png" width="425" align="right" alt="Situations: four tiles and the picked one's settings">

An experimental layout, off by default: **Extra → Other → Situations**. Four tiles take the place
of the Mode, GPU Mode and Screen blocks:

- **On the go**: Silent, Eco, 60 Hz, dim keyboard light
- **Desk**: Balanced, Standard, max Hz
- **Gaming**: Turbo, Standard, max Hz, bright keyboard light
- **Quiet**: Silent, Optimized, automatic Hz, keyboard light off

One click sets all four, so a tile always gives the same result. Under the tiles the picked
situation's settings can be changed (Ultimate included) and then folded away. Turn it off and the
classic layout is back.

## Install

### AppImage (any distribution)

Download [`shiftray-x86_64.AppImage`](https://github.com/sprinterz5/shiftray/releases/latest/download/shiftray-x86_64.AppImage),
then run it:

```bash
chmod +x shiftray-x86_64.AppImage
```

```bash
./shiftray-x86_64.AppImage
```

It adds itself to the app menu and opens Setup for anything the laptop is missing. Runs on
distributions with glibc 2.34 or newer: Fedora 35+, Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, Arch.

### Fedora (COPR)

For Fedora 43, 44, 45 and rawhide. asusctl and Cardwire come from the Terra repository, which
the app's Setup adds.

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable thesecondone/shiftray
```

```bash
sudo dnf install shiftray
```

### Arch (AUR)

`shiftray` goes up on the AUR as soon as its registration reopens. Until then, build it
from [`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`](packaging/aur/PKGBUILD) with `makepkg -si`. Cardwire is in the AUR.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sprinterz5/shiftray
```

```bash
./shiftray/bin/shiftray
```

Needs Python 3 with PySide6, python-evdev and dbus-python. Build the AppImage with
`packaging/appimage/build-in-podman.sh`.

## Requirements and support

| Needs | |
|---|---|
| **Laptop** | An ASUS laptop supported by [asusctl](https://asus-linux.org), ROG and TUF first of all |
| **GPU modes** | [Cardwire](https://opengamingcollective.github.io/cardwire/) and a kernel with BPF LSM (Fedora and Arch have it; Ubuntu needs a boot option) |
| **NVIDIA driver** | Optional: for games on the dGPU and its temperature |

| Desktop | Status |
|---|---|
| **KDE Plasma 6** | Main target, everything works: on-screen toasts, the logout prompt, windows opening at the tray icon |
| **GNOME** | Supported: Setup installs and turns on the AppIndicator extension for the tray icon (no logout when it was already installed). Toasts are short notifications, the logout prompt and screen-off key are GNOME's, the keyboard light timeout uses GNOME's idle monitor. Windows open where GNOME places them, not at the tray icon |
| **Sway, Hyprland, other wlroots** | Should work; refresh rate through `wlr-randr` |
| **X11** | Refresh rate through `xrandr` |

GNOME 50 was tested in a nested GNOME Shell on the same laptop, wlroots in containers; neither on a
real desktop session yet. A [report](#reporting-a-problem) from one helps.

## GPU modes

| Mode | What it does | Switching |
|---|---|---|
| **Eco** | Only the integrated GPU; the NVIDIA GPU powers off | A moment, no logout |
| **Standard** | Both GPUs; the NVIDIA GPU sleeps until a game or app uses it | A moment, no logout |
| **Ultimate** | The NVIDIA GPU drives the screen directly (MUX), for the most FPS | Reboot |
| **Optimized** | Eco on battery, Standard when plugged in | Automatic |

Eco and Standard go through Cardwire, the successor of supergfxd from the asus-linux and Open
Gaming Collective people. It never unloads the NVIDIA driver: it stops new programs from opening
the dGPU, which then powers down by itself. Programs already using the dGPU keep it awake until
they quit; the app names them and offers to close them.

## What it changes on your system

Day to day, the app only talks to asusd, Cardwire and the desktop. A few one-time steps change
the system; each is asked for, explained first, and listed in **Extra → System changes** with
Undo (the root ones together, one password):

| Change | When | Risk | Undo |
|---|---|---|---|
| udev rule: your user may read the ASUS hotkey device (not the keyboard) | Setup, for Fn keys | low | Undo |
| Your group may switch CPU boost (`/etc/tmpfiles.d`) | Setup, for CPU Boost per mode | low | Undo |
| KDE's power profile on plug / unplug set to "leave unchanged" | first start on KDE | low | Undo (old values restored) |
| Terra repository (Fedora) | Setup, for asusctl and Cardwire | medium | shown: `dnf remove terra-release` |
| power-profiles-daemon instead of tuned-ppd (Fedora) | Setup | medium | Undo |
| Cardwire instead of supergfxd | Setup | medium | shown: re-enable supergfxd |
| Kernel option `mem_sleep_default=deep` | Extra → Deep sleep (S3 laptops only) | high | Undo |
| KDE's PowerDevil starts without ddcutil (a drop-in in your home folder) | Setup, on KDE with Secure Boot and ddcutil 2.x, where PowerDevil crashes in Eco ([ddcutil#641](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/641)) | low | Undo |
| GNOME's AppIndicator extension installed (if missing) and turned on | Setup, on GNOME, for the tray icon | low | Undo turns it off; the package is in "Installed packages" |
| Autostart, menu entry, KWin placement script (home folder) | first start | low | Undo |

The list lives in [`system_changes.py`](shiftray/system_changes.py); a change that is not
there is a bug.

**Tools that change the same things.** TLP, auto-cpufreq, TuneD, supergfxd (next to Cardwire),
optimus-manager, system76-power, EnvyControl and g-helper-linux all set the power mode, the charge
limit or the GPU themselves, so modes stop sticking or the dGPU misbehaves. The app shows them in
Setup and as a line in the main window; Set up stops the services (Undo starts them again) and
says how to remove the rest. See [`conflicts.py`](shiftray/conflicts.py).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>The Fn keys do nothing</b></summary>

The app needs read access to the "Asus WMI hotkeys" device, and nothing else from the keyboard.
Open **Extra → Setup**; the "Laptop keys" row installs the rule. Some keys (Fn+F2 / F3 keyboard
light, Fn+Esc Fn-Lock) are handled by the firmware and never reach Linux.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Eco is on, but the NVIDIA GPU stays awake</b></summary>

A program opened it before the switch and still holds it. Hover the tray icon: the tooltip names
it. Close it, or turn on **Extra → Stop all apps using GPU when switching to Eco**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A red line says asusd or cardwired is not running</b></summary>

Click it to start the service. If that does not help, open **Extra → Setup**. On Ubuntu the
kernel starts without BPF LSM, which Cardwire needs; see
[Cardwire's docs](https://opengamingcollective.github.io/cardwire/).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The mode changes by itself when I plug in the charger</b></summary>

That is on purpose: each power source remembers the mode last used on it, as in G-Helper. Pick
the mode you want on battery once, and it comes back every time you unplug.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The battery charges past the limit</b></summary>

Most TUF and some ROG models stop charging only at 60-80% or at 100%; any other limit charges to
full, so the slider offers only 60, 80 and 100 there. Also, while the laptop is switched off and
plugged in, the firmware forgets the limit and charges to 100%; the limit is back once asusd
starts. In sleep it holds.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>KDE lost the battery icon, screen dimming or the lid action</b></summary>

PowerDevil, KDE's power manager, crashes at start while Eco hides the NVIDIA GPU, on Secure Boot
systems with ddcutil 2.x (Fedora 44 among them; fixed in ddcutil 3.0). **Extra → Setup** has a row
for it: PowerDevil then starts without ddcutil, losing only external monitors' brightness over DDC.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CPU Boost is greyed out</b></summary>

Writing the boost switch needs a one-time permission: open **Extra → Setup**, row "CPU Boost switch".
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Something else</b></summary>

The log is in `~/.local/state/shiftray/app.log`. Start the app with `--debug` to log every
command it runs. [docs/DEBUGGING.md](docs/DEBUGGING.md) maps symptoms to the code.
</details>

### Reporting a problem

**Extra → Diagnostics → Report a problem on GitHub** copies a text report and opens a new
[issue](https://github.com/sprinterz5/shiftray/issues) that says where to paste it: laptop model,
kernel, package versions, services, what asusd and Cardwire report, and their recent logs. Your
home folder, serial numbers and computer name are left out. "Save the report to a file" is there
too.

## Contributing

- **Testers with other ASUS laptops** help the most: a Diagnostics report and a few words on what
  works. ASUS mice, keyboards and headsets too; see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- **Translations**: copy `shiftray/translations/ru.json`, translate the values, open a pull request.
- **Code**: plain Python and Qt (PySide6). [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) shows
  where everything is, [docs/DEBUGGING.md](docs/DEBUGGING.md) how to find a bug, and
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .` runs the tests. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) lists what
  is next.
